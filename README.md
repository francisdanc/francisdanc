Hello there! I'm a Computer Science student from England currently in my second year at university. So far I am learning Java, C# and Python. I am interested in developing all kinds of software from machine learning to programming games. When programming games I am intersted in procedural generation and making a simulated world that feels alive.
This GitHub serves as a portfolio for projects i've made in my spare time.
